Interface - Map
	A Map is an object that maps keys to value. It cannot contain duplicate keys and each key can only map to one value.
	The contents can be viewed in three ways: a set of keys, a collection of values, or a set of key-value mappings. 

	It's not a good idea to have keys be mutable objects. The behavior of the equals comparisons can get wonky.
	A map cannot contain itself as a key. A map can contain itself as a value, but the equals comparison is not reliable.

	A map implementation shoud provide two constructors: a no arguments constructor and one that takes Map as an argument.
	All maps in the JDK have this implementation. The constructor with a map argument allows a copy of an existing map.
